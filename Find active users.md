To find **active users** who still have access to your server (especially those that may log in via SSH), and filter out deleted users whose home directories still exist, follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: List Existing Users from `/etc/passwd`**
This lists users currently present on the system.

```bash
awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 {print $1}' /etc/passwd
```
- This command shows **non-system users** (UID >= 1000) who might have login access.

---

### **Step 2: Check Users with SSH Access**  
If users can access your server remotely, they must be allowed in the SSH configuration.

1. **View the list of allowed SSH users** (if `AllowUsers` is specified):
   ```bash
   grep "^AllowUsers" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

2. If `AllowUsers` is not used, check if SSH login is enabled for all users:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/passwd | grep "/bin/bash" | awk -F: '{print $1}'
   ```

---

### **Step 3: List Users with Existing Home Directories**  
This will show directories still present under `/home/` (even if the users were deleted):

```bash
ls /home/
```

If any of these directories belong to deleted users, youâ€™ll need to **compare with active users** from `/etc/passwd` (Step 1).  

---

### **Step 4: Find Home Directories without Matching Users**
To identify **home directories without matching active users**, run:

```bash
for user in $(ls /home); do
  if ! id -u "$user" &>/dev/null; then
    echo "Home directory exists but user $user is deleted."
  fi
done
```

---

### **Step 5: Check for Users with Valid SSH Keys**  
Even if users are deleted, someone might have **left SSH keys** that allow access:

```bash
find /home/*/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

- This will show if any `authorized_keys` files remain in deleted users' home directories.  
- If you find any, you might need to **manually remove those files** to prevent unauthorized access.

---

### **Step 6: Disable or Lock Old Users**
For users you find unnecessary, you can lock or delete them:

- **Lock a user** (disables login):
  ```bash
  usermod -L username
  ```

- **Remove old user directories** (after verification):
  ```bash
  rm -rf /home/username
  ```

---

These steps should help you identify actual active users and clean up any remaining home directories for deleted users. Let me know if you need further help!
